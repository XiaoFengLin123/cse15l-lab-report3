**Part 1**

The bug we'll be using is within the reversed method, which returns a new array with all of the elements of the input array in reverse order. 

The Buggy program: 
``` 
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```

Failure Inducing Input: 
```
  @Test 
  public void testReversed2() { 
    int[] input2 = {2,3,4,5,6,7}
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{7,6,5,4,3,2}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input2)); 
  } 
```

Non Failure Inducing Input: 
```
  @Test
    public void testReversed() {
      int[] input1 = { };
      assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

Old with buggy code: 
``` 
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```

New with fixed code:

```
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```

The fixed code address the issues with the old code by filling in the `newArray` with elements from the original array `arr` itself. By using changing `newArrya[i] = arr[arr.length - i - i]` from `arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1]`. We are able to get the elements from the original array in a reverse order and put them into the new array. It ensures that elements from the end of `arr` is placed corresponding to the start of the `newArray`. The changed code also outputs the new array `newArray` with the reversed elements instead of the original array `arr` which allowed the `testReversed()` to pass since it just outputs an empty array since it doesn't need to reverse the elements within an empty array. 

**Part 2**

`grep -i pattern file_name`
`-i` command
First Example: 
Input: `grep -i desktop biomed/*.txt` 

Output: 
```

biomed/gb-2003-4-6-r41.txt:        a desktop computer. To make this methodology better suited
```

In this example, `grep -i desktop biomed/*txt` goes through all of the .txt files and outputs the files that contain the word `desktop` within `biomed` directory. The -I option makes the search case-insensitive, meaning it will look through all of the files that contain the word DESKTOP, Desktop or Desktop, etc. This command is useful for finding occurrences of the word "desktop" across multiple text files in a specific directory, which could be helpful for reviewing mentions of desktop environments, desktop applications, or other desktop-related content in text files.

Second Example:
Input: `grep -i PH biomed/1471-2091-3-17.txt`

Output:

In this example, `grep -i PH biomed/1471-2091-3-17.txt` goes through all of the `1471-2091-3-17.txt` file within the `biomed` directory and outputs the files that contain the word `pH` within `biomed` directory. The -i option makes the search case-insensitive. It allows the command to find "pH", "Ph", "pH", and "PH", treating them all as equivalent. This command is useful for finding occurrences of the word "ph" within a specific file, which can be useful in separating scientific information and data within scientific works to find all mentions of pH regardless of how it is capitalized in the document.

The command grep `-w drinking government/Alcohol_Problems/Session2-PDF.txt` searches for the word `"drinking"` as a whole word in the file Session2-PDF.txt located within the government/Alcohol_Problems directory. This is ideal for pinpointing discussions or references to "drinking" in the context of alcohol usage, ensuring that only relevant occurrences are considered. -w is case sensitive, meaning If we want to search for `Drinking` instead of `drinking,` we would get a completely different result and only display text that contains the word `Drinking` within the `government/Alcohol_Problems/Session2-PDF.txt` file, helping filter out words that don't meet the criteria. 

Second Example: 

input: `grep -w years plos/journal.pbio.0020042.txt`

output:
```
        During the last few years, we have seen enormous strides in our abilities to sequence
```

The -w option to grep searches for the exact word within a file and returns the line that contains that word. In the second example, we searched for the word years within the `journal.pbio.0020042.txt` file within technical/plos directory which so happens to be the first line of the text. This option to grep is especially helpful if you want to search for a specific word within a file and want it to match exactly in spelling and want it to be case sensitive. 

`grep -r pattern *`
`-r` command
First Example: 
Input: `grep -r "thanks" plos`

Output: 
```
$ grep -r "thanks" plos

plos/pmed.0020047.txt:        thanks to the Public Library of Science for leading the campaign that is now gaining
```

The `grep -r "thanks" plos` is used to search recursively for the string "thanks" within all files and subdirectories in the plos directory. it searches recursively through all directories and subdirectories to look for and match files that contain the word `thanks`. This is beneficial because it provides a quick way to search through large volumes of text without needing to open and read each file manually

Second Example: 

Input: `grep -r "thanks" *`

Output:

The command `grep -r "thanks" *` searches recursively for the string "thanks" in all files and directories starting from the current directory, which is technical/. it tells `grep` to search for `thanks` recursively, meaning it will look into every file in the current directory and all subdirectories. The `*` or wild card character means that we will search through all of the files and directories within the current directory, which is the `technical/`directory. This command is very useful for searching through a large number of files or a complex directory structure without needing to open each file manually. It can quickly locate all instances of a specific word or phrase. It also provides the file directories where the word appears, which can help in understanding how the word is being used across different documents.

`grep -v pattern file_name`
`-v` command

First Example: 

Input: `grep -v t 911report/chapter-6.txt`

The command `grep -v t 911report/chapter-6.txt` is used to filter and display lines from the file `911report/chapter-6.txt` that do not contain the letter `"t"`. The `-v` option inverts the search, meaning grep will return only the lines that do not match the search pattern. This can be particularly useful if you want to exclude certain information from the output or focus on lines that lack a specific character or pattern.
It can be used for data cleaning, or, in this example, to reach lines that don't mention or contain the word `CIA`.

The `-v` command to `grep` is used to inverse the search of `he` and print all lines that do not contain the matching pattern. In the second example, we can see that it printed all of the lines that doesn't contain the characters `he`, meaning it didn't print lines that contains words like `the` because `"he"`is within the word `the` It searches through the `government/Media/Advocate_for_Poor.txt` file and looks for the lines that doesn't match the pattern. This can be especially helpful when you want to analyze a piece of text that may potentially exclude the use of pronouns such as `he` or prevent the use of the words `The`. It can also clean up text data by removing lines that are likely to be less relevant.
